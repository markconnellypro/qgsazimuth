# QGIS Azimuth and Distance Plugin

This plugin aims to help users that want to create geometries from a list of
azimuths and distances, such as the description on some old land registration
documents.

This plugin is primarily in maintenance mode. While the maintainer will attempt
to fix bugs, this may take some time. Pull requests are welcome, but there is
otherwise no active feature development.
